# MaskAlert: Alarm-Based Face Mask Detection System

## 📋 Project Description
MaskAlert is a real-time face mask detection system that uses computer vision and machine learning to identify if individuals are wearing masks. If a mask is not detected, the system triggers an alarm to enhance public safety in crowded areas.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time face mask detection using a webcam or video feed.
- Alarm activation if no mask is detected.
- High accuracy with a pre-trained deep learning model.
- User-friendly interface for easy monitoring.
- Scalable and can be integrated into existing security systems.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Flask
- **Model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Deployment:** Local system or cloud-based options

## 📦 Installation Guide
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Sayanmaity2003/Vision-Mask-X.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
  cd Vision-Mask-X

3.Install required dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
4. Run the application:
  python app.py

📊 Usage
Run the app to start real-time detection.
Monitor the video feed for mask detection alerts.
Alarm sounds if a mask is not detected.

⚠️ Limitations
Requires a stable camera setup for accurate detection.
Detection accuracy may vary in low-light conditions.
